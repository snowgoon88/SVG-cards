## Introduction

SVG-cards is a fork of [SVG-cards 2.0.1](http://svg-cards.sourceforge.net/),
which was created by [David Bellot](http://david.bellot.free.fr/). He writes
in the README of the original package:

> This is a set of playing cards made in pure SVG with all kings, queens,
> jacks, numbers, jokers and backs of cards. This set of SVG files is intended
> to be used in games, figures, illustrations, web sites as long as you
> provide the code source and the LGPL license (see the COPYING file).
> Although this is a free software, the license is the LGPL so you can use
> this set of cards even in a non-free software.
>
> The kings, queens and jacks are based on the French representation, because
> I find them beautiful. You can access to each either by rendering the file
> into a pixmap and clipping each card or by using their name with a DOM
> interface.

I agree with David that these cards are beautiful! I am grateful for his work
and that he published them under an open source license. However, while
playing around with the SVG file containing the cards, I found that using the
cards in SVG was not as straightforward as I would have liked. For example, I
expected the following line,

```svg
<use href="svg-cards.svg#joker_red" x="40" y="12"/>
```

To put the red joker card with its top-left corner at (40, 12). It does not,
as it takes into account the place of the red joker in the SVG file: the card
top-left corner shows up at (207.575, 750.55).

In this fork I translated all cards to set their top-left corner at the origin
(0,0). After this change, the above USE element works as expected: it places
the red joker card's top-left corner at (40, 12).

## Usage

SVG-cards is just an SVG file. You use it like you would any other SVG file.
See [MDN's documentation about
SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) to learn about SVG. 

### Detailed installation and usage instruction

1.  Go to the directory you want to install and use the SVG cards:

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/dir
    ```

2.  Install or download SVG cards. Use one of the following three
    alternatives:

    * Install via NPM: 
      
      ```bash
      npm install --save svg-cards
      ```

      In the example below (step 3), replace all occurrences of
      `href="svg-cards.svg"` by `href="node_modules/svg-cards/svg-cards.svg"`.
    
    * Clone this repository:

      ```bash
      clone git@github.com:htdebeer/SVG-cards.git
      ```

      In the example below (step 3), replace all occurrences of
      `href="svg-cards.svg"` by `href="svg-cards/svg-cards.svg"`.

    * Download the
      [SVG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/htdebeer/SVG-cards/master/svg-cards.svg)
      file.

3.  Create a file `test.html` in that directory with the following contents:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Example SVG with cards</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Example SVG with cards</h1>
        <svg 
          width="600"
          height="400"
          xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
          >

          <!-- The cards have a natural width of 169.075 and a height of 244.640. Its
            center is located at (+98.0375, +122.320). -->
          <!-- The original back color was #0062ff. The color of the back card can
            be changed by setting the fill on the USE-element. -->

            <use href="svg-cards.svg#back" x="150" y="10" fill="red"/>
            <use href="svg-cards.svg#heart_1" x="0" y="0"/>
            <use href="svg-cards.svg#joker_black" x="100" y="100"/>
            <use href="svg-cards.svg#spade_10" x="200" y="200" 
                 transform="rotate(45,198.0375,122.320)scale(0.5)"
                />
            <use href="svg-cards.svg#club_jack" x="300" y="100" 
                 transform="rotate(75,198.0375,122.320)scale(0.75)"
                />
        </svg>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

    We use inline SVG in our HTML document. Inside that inline SVG we refer
    and link to the `svg-cards.svg` file via the
    [`USE`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use)
    element.

    * For transforming the cards after including them in your SVG with the
      `USE` element, it is good to know that the cards have the following
      natural dimensions:

      - width: 169.075
      - height: 244.64
      - center: (+98.0375, +122.320)

    * You can change the color of the back card by setting the fill on the
      USE-element. For example:

      ```svg
      <use href="svg-cards.svg#back" x="150" y="10" fill="red"/>
      ```
    
    * The various cards have the following names:

      - Jokers: *joker_black* and *joker_red*
      - Back card: *back* or *alternative-back*
      - Picture cards:
        {*club*,*diamond*,*heart*,*spade*}*_*{*king*,*queen*,*jack*}
      - Pip
        cards:{*club*,*diamond*,*heart*,*spade*}*_*{*1*,*2*,*3*,*4*,*5*,*6*,*7*,*8*,*9*,*10*}

      Examples:

      - The ace of club is `club_1`.
      - The queen of diamonds is `diamond_queen`.

      And so onâ€¦

    * The following extra shapes are also available:

      - *card-base*, with the same dimensions as a card
      - *suit-club*
      - *suit-heart*
      - *suit-diamond*
      - *suit-spade*

      These suit shapes have the following dimensions:

      - width: 15.42
      - height: 15.88
      - center: (7.71, 7.94)

    * The default back card might be too complex to be rendered swiftly in a
      web browser. For example, when I rendered a deck of 52 cards facing
      down, it took my browser almost 2 seconds to render about 50,000
      elements in the DOM. To overcome these issues, use a simplified
      alternative back card with name `alternate-back`.

4.  Run a web server in that same directory, for example using the JavaScript
    program [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server):

    ```bash
    http-server .
    ```

    This will start a web server that serves the current directory on port
    8080.

5.  Open a web browser like [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and navigate to
    [http://localhost:8080/test.html](http://localhost:8080/test.html). 

    You should see the example with the five cards shown at the top of this
    README.

## Development

### Readable SVG

I have also added a nicely formatted SVG file, `svg-cards-indented.svg`, which
makes the SVG file easier to inspect using a text editor. Converting from
indented to unindented version goes via
[xmllint](http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html): 

```bash
xmllint --noblanks svg-cards-indented.svg > svg-cards.svg
```

### PNG rendering

To automatically convert these SVG files to PNG I developed a separate
project: [svg-cards-to-png](https://github.com/htdebeer/svg-cards-to-png). For
convenience, this repository contains PNG files in the `png`
subdirectory. In the two directories `png/1x` and `png/2x` you find PNG files
of the SVG cards with, respectively, their natural dimensions and twice their
natural dimensions. Furthermore, these PNG files come with 16 different colored back cards.

### NPM package

[desphilboy](https://github.com/desphilboy) has made this project into an
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) package to make it easier for web developers to
use it in their projects. Now it can be installed and used like other
dependencies: 

```bash
npm install --save svg-cards
```

### SVG compliance

In July 2018, [Thomas Linard](https://github.com/thlinard) improved the SVG
files by making them compliant with the [SVG
specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/).

### French Version, moved small card Icon

In december 2020, [snowgoon88](https://github.com/snowgoon88) added some tools to generate "french" cards, one by one, where the icon for the suit color is directly left of the card value. This cards are generated from 'svg-cards.svg' (with french V, D and R instead of J, Q, K) and can be exported to PNG using './to_png.sh'.
